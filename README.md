# hello-world
Respository used while I learn the basics of Git and GitHub.


I'm a new, excited game-developer in the making that is eager to learn the ends
and outs of coding. I know that this is a lot to take on considering there are 
infinite ways to code, but I am up for the challenge and am ready to start my coding
journey. In 2018, I hope to attend Full Sail University in pursuit of a Bachelors degree
in Game Development.
